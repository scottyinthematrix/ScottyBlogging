about
======
this product should have a blogging service for basic operations on posts, such as adding/updating/deleting/fetching;

for the backend, Entity Framwork will be used, as i think this is still the best ORM solution on .NET;

since this will be accessed from different kinds of clients, such as mobile/pc, all the client side should rely on the blogging service only, no more any other deployments and dependencies;

for the UI side, we probably have below means from the client side: web/mobile/pc, and for the mobile, android will the first platform for this, as seems there's a tool/framework named MonoAndroid serves for this;

backend storage
===============
Entity Framework will be chosen as the backend storage technique, and Code First will be used, instead of any other EF related techniques, such as POCO, Model First/Database First, STE.


service
========
WCF will be used for building a service layer.


UI side - pc : web
=========
MVC is absolutly needed, with the best effects and user experiences.

UI side - pc : wpf?
============
this should has the least priority, as i'm not sure what kind of client platform should i choose, WinForm is not in my consideration list, wpf may be a good choice, but what about portability when moving it to Linux? and even more, the win8 is comming, may be i should study some metro style programming;

UI side - mobile : web
==============
i think WebAPI is one of the best choices.
